# Library Management System
This repository contains a library management system developed using Python for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for managing library resources, including books, patrons, and borrowing records.

# Features
The library management system offers the following features:

Book Management: Add, edit, and remove books from the library catalog. Each book entry includes information such as title, author, ISBN, genre, and availability status.

Patron Management: Maintain a database of library patrons, including their names, contact information, and borrowing history.

Borrowing and Returning: Enable patrons to borrow books and track borrowing transactions. The system records the due dates and sends reminders for overdue books. It also allows patrons to return books and updates the availability status accordingly.

Search and Filter: Provide search and filter options to facilitate book discovery and availability checks. Patrons can search for books by title, author, or genre to find relevant resources.

User Authentication: Implement user authentication to secure the system and restrict access to authorized library staff. Administrators can create user accounts with different roles and permissions.

# Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

backend: This folder contains the Python code for the backend logic, including database management, API endpoints, and business logic.
frontend: This folder contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the frontend interface. It includes the user interface design, forms, and interactive elements.
database: This folder stores the database file or scripts used by the system to store and retrieve data.
docs: This folder contains any additional documentation or user guides for the library management system.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, features, repository structure, and instructions for getting started.
Dependencies
To run the library management system, you will need the following dependencies:

# Python 3.x
Flask (Python web framework)
SQLite or any other preferred database system
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-compatible web browser
Getting Started
To get started with the library management system, follow these steps:

# Clone this repository to your local machine.
Set up the backend:
Install Python and the required packages by running pip install -r backend/requirements.txt.
Configure the database settings in the backend code, ensuring the connection details match your database system.
Start the backend server by running python backend/app.py.

# Set up the frontend:

Open the frontend files in a code editor.
Modify any necessary configuration files, such as API endpoints or database connection settings, to match your backend setup.
Open the HTML files in a web browser to interact with the library management system.
Use the user interface to add books, manage patrons, record borrowing and returning transactions, and perform searches and filters.
Explore the backend code and frontend files for customization and further development.

# Conclusion

The library management system provides a comprehensive solution for efficiently managing library resources, patrons, and borrowing transactions. It simplifies the process of adding and searching for books, tracking borrowing history, and maintaining a well-organized library catalog. Feel free to explore the code and customize the system according to your specific library requirements.
